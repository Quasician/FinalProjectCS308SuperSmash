### Team SuperCS308Bros

For this project, team members are expected to be in regular communication with each other regarding what they are working on, the progress they are making, and whether they need additional help. Moreover, students will also be expected to produce weekly commits, showing that they are constantly thinking about the project, even if they aren’t working on this project all day, every day. 
Students are also expected to abide by the basic best design practices. If they aren’t sure how exactly to design something in the best way, students should be willing to ask for help along with other members of the team be willing to give help. Moreover, if students are going to make changes to the API, they should discuss those changes with the rest of the team. Students are also expected to participate in team meetings regarding planning, major design decisions, and group presentations. Finally, and most importantly, students should make sure that they are keeping in touch with each other on a regular basis, even if it’s not necessarily related to the project.
